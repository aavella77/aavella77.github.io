    "I hope these notes may help someone trying to get started with Deep Learning.  Not sure we need another tutorial, so I'll try to add some value with these Deep Learning Notes.  Hope you follow along...\n",

    "**Pre-requisites:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't try this tutorial at home if you are new to this area.  If you are an artificial intelligence newbie, I recommend first reading [Jay Alammar's 2 introductory blogs](http://jalammar.github.io/visual-interactive-guide-basics-neural-networks/).  After that, I recommend watching the [3BLUE1BROWN SERIES on Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi).  It is a bit long, but it is the best intuition I have found.  I highly recommend watch them and stop and rewind if you don't get something.  Don't get scared about the math, especially now that there some many tools on the Internet, for example you can try to plot the [sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) or [tanh](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Tanh.html) functions on [Desmos graph tool](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) or [multiply a matrix with Calcul](http://www.calcul.com/show/calculator/matrix-multiplication_;4;2;2;4?matrix1=[[%221%22,%220%22],[%220%22,%221%22],[%223%22,%220%22],[%220%22,%225%22]]&matrix2=[[%220%22,%221%22,%220%22,%220%22],[%222%22,%220%22,%221%22,%220%22]]&operator=*).  If you never heard about what a derivative is about, don't worry, check this animation from [Wolfram on derivatives](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TheTangentLineProblem/). It is just the slope of the curve at some point. You will hear about gradients. The gradient is a multi-variable generalization of the derivative. While a derivative can be defined on functions of a single variable, for functions of several variables, the gradient takes its place. The gradient is a vector-valued function, as opposed to a derivative, which is scalar-valued. You will need to learn some linear algebra, which you can understand from these [3BLUE1BROWN SERIES on Linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab).  Another thing that you could do is take the [Kaggle free courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview).\n",

    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In college I passed 7 math courses, but they did not pass through me.  There is some level of math required for deep learning, however, deep Learning for Neural Networks always follows the same steps.  I think in a nutshell these are the steps that it boils down to.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize parameters / Define hyperparameters\n",
    "2. Loop for num_iterations:\n",
    "    1. Forward propagation\n",
    "    2. Compute cost function\n",
    "    3. Backward propagation\n",
    "    4. Update parameters (using parameters, and grads from backprop) \n",
    "4. Use trained parameters to predict labels\n",

    "\n",
    "[Daniel Smilkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsmilkov/) and [Shan Carter](http://shancarter.com/) created a [wonderful tool](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2,2&seed=0.08014&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) that helps people to play around with neural network parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "They just created the page and they don't explain much about the different parameters.  So, I'll try to give you some pointers.  First, you have the input X with two features (x1 and x2). Then there are several layers of neurons and weights (W) between them with a bias (b)( Look at the lines between neurons).  These are the parameters W and b that you need to adjust while training the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way it works is kind of cool.  The concept is that you show the neural network some samples and the idea is that the neural networks \"learns\".  By learning, I mean finding the correct weights and biases.  But, how can you do that automatically? Well, with repeated forward and backward propagation steps.  The real trick was initially devised by [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton).  He proposed to use backward propagation by adjusting the weights and biases.  I think [Andrej Karpathy](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/) explained the best in this [Stanford lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59Hbtz7XgjM). The whole idea is to minimize the cost function while iteraring throught the training examples\n",
    "\n",
    "FInally, the idea is that we want to predict with a new test set.  So, we show the neural network a new example and it should be able to predict correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This explanation is how I understand it, with my limited knowledge.  Please feel free to comment below.\n",
