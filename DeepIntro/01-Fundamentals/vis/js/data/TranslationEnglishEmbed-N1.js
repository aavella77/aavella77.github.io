century of biometrics &quot; .','Biometrics will be the only way of guaranteeing the identity of an individual carrying out transactions in a world as transverse and transnational as the Internet .','Organisations devoted to privacy protection note this fascination for biometrics , but are concerned .','In France alone in 2011 , the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties authorised 774 imprint recognition systems , for recognising fingerprints , the shape of the hand or networks of veins in the hand , for businesses , institutions , cafeterias , etc .','&quot; Everyone will soon be identifiable , anywhere and any time , &quot; says a concerned Justin <unk0> , consumer privacy director for the CDT ( Center for Democracy and Technology ) in Washington .','But why such optimism for some and pessimism for others ?','Biometrics will rely on new technologies that will enable new services to be provided to citizens and consumers .','In France today , the most commonly used biometric data are fingerprints , hand geometry and the network of veins in the palm or fingers .','But each of these techniques has its limitations .','&quot; For example , people who work with cement have damage to their fingers that renders their fingerprints unreadable , &quot; notes Philippe Robin , technical director for identification at Thales Communications &amp; Security .','Furthermore , the detection and verification of a network of veins or of hand geometry require a voluntary and specific gesture on the part of individuals .','It is both a security mechanism - this data cannot be captured without people knowing - and an inconvenience - the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and so takes time .','As a consequence , research has been conducted over the past twenty years into other methods , such as face or iris recognition ( the coloured part of the eye ) .','Thanks to the improved precision of the sensors and the calculating capacity of the computers used to analyse this data , these techniques are becoming practical .','The accuracy of face recognition has improved tenfold over the past five years , considers <unk0> <unk1> , R &amp; D laboratory director at Accenture in Europe .','With our help , the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automated passport gates that use face recognition .','It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris .','&quot; Today we are carrying out research into voice and gait recognition using sonic sensors , but it requires a silent environment , &quot; says <unk0> <unk1> , director of security research at Intel Labs .','DNA , a unique and <unk0> marker , also arouses hope and concern .','&quot;

We are gathering images from surveillance cameras and comparing them with photos of celebrities that are freely available on the Internet , &quot; explains Dany <unk0> , business development director for biometric identification solutions at NEC France .','Another use is to take a photo of someone queuing in a shop , follow his progress using face recognition and work out the waiting time .','Authentication initially concerned physical ( at borders , in protected locations , in a cafeteria etc . ) or digital presence ( logging on to a computer ) .','Added to this , more recently , are presence checks .','&quot; A biometric <unk0> prevents the situation where one colleague clocks in on behalf of another , &quot; asserts <unk1> <unk2> from Accenture .','But , more and more , authentication will also involve transactions , in particular those carried out using devices connected to the Internet .','In Japan , it is already possible to withdraw money from some cash machines by inserting your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader : this gesture replaces the use of a PIN .','','The experiment is expected to last six months .','If it is conclusive , biometric readers could soon be seen in shops in France .','Ways to reassure users','There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public .','The first is to explain how it can save time .','&quot;

Digital fingerprints are stored in a primary server ; the identities of individuals are in a second database . The correlation between the two sets of information is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box , which locks up if anyone tries to move it , &quot; specifies Philippe Robin from Thales .','However , given the lack of in-depth studies , it is impossible to know if this line will really convince users .','Privacy protection specialists continue to be concerned .','&quot; The advances in face recognition , the increase in the number of surveillance cameras and the huge number of photos available on Facebook , Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst : widespread surveillance , &quot; predicts Andrew Patrick from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada .','Minister Accused of Child Pornography in Nova Scotia','A minister who was in charge of children in the area of Halifax , Nova Scotia , has been accused of child pornography .','Aaron <unk0> , aged 30 , was arrested on Friday morning following a search at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works .','<unk0> Baptist Church , where he <unk1> as minister , said it was deeply saddened by the news .','In a statement , church officials said that Mr <unk0> had resigned from his post .','The minister has been conditionally released .','To be specific , he is not allowed to communicate with anyone under 18 or to access the Internet .','He shall appear before the provincial court in Halifax in December .','European Markets , Except London , Fall in <unk0>','The major European stock markets , except London , are on a down trend in <unk0> this Friday .

It is not a matter of something we might choose to do , &quot; said Hasan <unk0> , executive director of the Southern California <unk1> of Governments , which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025 .','There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes .','The technology is there to do it .','The push comes as the country &apos;s Highway Trust Fund , financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump , is broke .','Americans don &apos;t buy as much gas as they used to .','Cars get many more miles to the gallon .','The federal tax itself , 18.4 cents per gallon , hasn &apos;t gone up in 20 years .','Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high .','&quot; The gas tax is just not sustainable , &quot; said Lee <unk0> , a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota .','His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a <unk0> system .','&quot; This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he said .','<unk0> call it a <unk1> user fee .','It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals , as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases , for example .','California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .','But Rep.

This is not just a tax going into a black hole , &quot; said Adrian Moore , vice president of policy at Reason .','People are paying more directly into what they are getting .','The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries , who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the <unk0> direction .','The U.S. Senate approved a $ <unk0> pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars .','But the House leadership killed the proposal , acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town .','Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .','The most eager is Oregon , which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country &apos;s biggest experiment .','Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state .','Nevada has already completed a pilot .','New York City is looking into one .','Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks .','And the <unk0> Coalition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern <unk1> ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is studying how they could go about implementing the change .','The concept is not a universal hit .','In Nevada , where about 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move .','&quot; Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem , &quot; said <unk0> Khan , who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation .','It was not something people wanted .','As the trial got underway , the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website : &quot; It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices . &quot;','There is no need to build an enormous , unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals &apos; everyday comings and goings .','Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .','If you can do that , Khan said , the public gets more comfortable .','The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage .','The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers .','It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mileage .','But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don &apos;t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information , uploaded periodically by modem .','&quot; People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location , &quot; said Ryan Morrison , chief executive of True Mileage .','There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs .','There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this .','In Oregon , planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices .','They can choose a device with or without GPS .','Or they can choose not to have a device at all , opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .','Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more , not less .','In New York City , transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees , provide &quot; <unk0> &quot; insurance , and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic .','&quot; <unk0> would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , &quot; says a city planning document .','Some transportation planners , though , wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction .','At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area , officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes .','An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don &apos;t use much gas , so they pay their fair share .','&quot;

Ethan <unk1> , who , with his brother Joel , has won several Oscars and Cannes prizes , told the press .','Even though <unk0> Davis never existed , the two directors , who are folk music fans , based their story on real people of the time , such as folk musician Dave Van <unk1> .','The idea was to portray the moment preceding the advent of Greenwich Village , the New York district destined to become &quot; the epicentre of the folk music boom that created international stars &quot; , according to the journalist Elijah Wald , a friend of Van <unk0> .','','The <unk0> brothers &apos; magic continues to work by integrating a comical character who is permanently on screen : a magnificent , cute ginger cat who is <unk1> Davis &apos;

put back the schedule for implementing the project and , in particular , the date for closing the emergency unit which cannot take place on November 4 &quot; .','This was an official request made so as &quot; not to run any risks when dealing with emergency services in Paris at the start of winter &quot; , but also aimed at avoiding to hinder the Socialist Party &apos;s campaign a few months before local elections .','Despite the minister &apos;s instructions , the closure is nevertheless expected to take effect on this date .','At the <unk0> , officials prefer the term &quot; transformation &quot; or &quot; change in continuity &quot; to closure .','From November 4 , the units of the fire brigade , which accounted for a quarter of the 40,000 cases brought to the emergency unit of the <unk0> each year , will all have received instructions to take their about thirty serious cases per day to the emergency units of other hospitals in Paris .','November 4 is also the day on which hospital training resumes .','At the <unk0> , interns specialising in emergencies will make way for five general medicine interns on Monday .','The transfer of internal medicine beds is scheduled for some point during the month .','','&quot;

he also assures .','But the decision to close the emergency service resides with the regional health agency ( ARS ) .','&quot; Things are moving gradually , &quot; says Nicolas <unk0> , spokesman for the ARS , for whom &quot; there will be no change in terms of the service offered &quot; , come November 4 .','','<unk0> from his position as head of emergency services in early July for taking a stand against the reorganisation project , he defines himself as a &quot; whistle-blower &quot; in the face of a &quot; cynical &quot; decision taken by the &quot; technical medical administration body &quot; .','&quot; They are in the process of abandoning and killing off emergency units that were reformed less than five years ago , &quot; he believes .','For him , &quot; if the other emergency services in Paris were able to absorb the surplus , there wouldn &apos;t be a problem . &quot;','But they are regularly saturated .','For example , there is sometimes a nine hour wait at the emergency unit at <unk0> .','The ARS stresses that thirty patients &quot; despatched &quot; to several locations does not run the risk of becoming an &quot; avalanche &quot; for the other emergency services , where human resources would have been reinforced anyway .','The ARS , like the <unk0> , is defending the &quot; new hospital model &quot; which started being implemented on October 7 and is expected to continue taking 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year .','By the end of the year , self-employed GPs are also expected to participate in the implementation of an &quot; ambulatory care service &quot; .','','&quot; The same thing will happen as with level 3 maternity units .','People are not stupid , they will go wherever the best care is offered . &quot;','&quot; If the minister does not take a step by Monday , we will take a different approach , &quot; warns Christophe <unk0> , emergency medical officer and member of the healthcare CGT .','&quot; We will have a greater presence in the local election campaigns and we will think about putting up a list . &quot;','In Nathalie <unk0> &apos;s team , Vincent Roger , a UMP councillor in Paris and MP of the 4th arrondissement , states clearly that &quot; even if the UMP in Paris supports the continuation of emergency services at <unk1> , it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if you look at the duties . &quot;','Ann Hidalgo , the Socialist Party &apos;s candidate , repeated on Monday morning on France Inter that she was in favour of a moratorium to prevent the closure on November 4 .','If it went ahead , she would register her clear disagreement , stresses Bruno <unk0> , her spokesman .','&quot;

Depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the FAA said in a statement .','Currently , passengers are required to turn off their smartphones , tablets and other devices once a plane &apos;s door closes .','They &apos;re not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead .','Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground .','Under the new guidelines , airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during <unk0> , landings and <unk1> , the FAA said .','Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria .','Laura <unk0> , president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants , welcomed the changes .','&quot;

Claire <unk0> , <unk1> . , contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions .','The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous .','Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices .','The FAA began restricting passengers &apos; use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios , the high-tech gadgets of their day .','New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference .','Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years .','Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference .','The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines , <unk0> said .','Today &apos;s electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices .','<unk0> , for example , emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page .','But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data .','Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers &apos; use of the devices has been <unk0>','In 2011 , company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle <unk0> and flew it around to test for problems but found none .','FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk .','Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal .','Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems , and most of those reports are very old .','However , the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility .','A travel industry group welcomed the changes , calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now <unk0> with technology .','&quot; We &apos;re pleased the FAA
